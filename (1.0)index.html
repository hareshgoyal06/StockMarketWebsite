            <p style="text-align:left; font-size:20px; margin-left:5%; margin-right: 50%;">
            The stock market refers to a variety of exchanges and other places where publicly traded firms' shares can be purchased and sold. These financial transactions take occur on established official exchanges (physical or electronic) and over-the-counter (OTC) markets that are governed by a set of rules.
            <br>
            <br>
                While "stock market" and "stock exchange" are sometimes used interchangeably, the latter is really a subset of the former. Stock market traders purchase and sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that make up the entire stock market.
            <br>
            <br>
                The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq are the two most important stock exchanges in the United States. Canada has its own stock exchange, known as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), more known for its selection of Canadian companies.

                In such trading operations, the stock exchange is responsible for assuring price transparency, liquidity, price discovery, and fair transactions.
            <br>
            <br> 
                The exchange maintains trading systems that efficiently process buy and sell orders from diverse market participants, as practically all major stock exchanges across the world now function electronically. They execute the price-matching function to make trade execution easier for both buyers and sellers at a fair price.
            <br>
            <br> 
                The stock exchange frequently generates and maintains numerous market-level and sector-specific indices, such as the S&P (Standard & Poor's) 500 index and the Nasdaq 100 index, to track the overall market's behaviour.

                Stock markets provide a safe and regulated environment in which market participants may confidently trade shares and other qualified financial instruments with little to no danger of losing money. The stock markets operate as primary and secondary markets, according to the guidelines set forth by the regulator. 
            <br>
            <br> 
                The stock market, as a primary market, permits corporations to issue and sell their shares to the general public for the first time through an initial public offering (IPO) (IPO). This practise aids businesses in obtaining the funding they want from investors.
            <br>
            <br> 
                This simply implies that a corporation splits itself into a number of shares (for example, 20 million) and sells part of those shares to the public for a price (for example, $10 per share). 
            <br>
            <br>
                A corporation will require a marketplace where these shares may be sold to make this process easier. The stock market provides this marketplace.
            <br>
            <br>
            If all goes according to plan, the corporation will be able to sell its 5 million shares for $10 each, netting $50 million. Investors will then purchase firm shares in the hopes of increasing their value or receiving dividend payments, or both.
            <br>
