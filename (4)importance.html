According to a 2020 Federal Reserve research, around 25% of non-retirees were not saving for retirement. Everyone, however, needs to invest in order to build wealth, combat inflation, and save for retirement and other financial goals.
                <br><br>
                Investing does not have to entail big quantities of money saved. Compound interest allows you to make money on your initial investment plus any collected interest from prior periods. While everyone should invest, everyone's investment approach is unique to their personal and financial goals.

                <br>Investing your money is essential for several reasons. You want to build wealth to aid you in times of need, if you lose your career, or for future aspirations. You should also take advantage of compounding while accounting for inflation so that your money does not lose value over time. Furthermore, if you intend to quit working and retire at some time, investment is critical to achieving those objectives.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Wealth Creation</h1>
            <p style="font-size:20px; margin:10%;">To various people, wealth might imply different things. It might be characterized as a certain quantity of money in your bank account or as financial objectives you establish for yourself. Investing can help you get there in any case.
                <br><br>
                If you want to pay off debt, send your child to college, purchase a house, start a company, or save for retirement, investment can help you get there faster than cash in your bank account. You may develop wealth via investing, which is the rise in the value of all of your assets.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Retirement</h1>
            <p style="font-size:20px; margin:10%;">If you intend to retire and stop working, you must have a substantial amount of money saved to live on after you no longer work. Investing can help bridge the gap between what you save and what you need to live on for the next 20 or 30 years. To begin investing for retirement, move backward from a retirement savings goal you establish for yourself.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><br>Inflation</h1>
            <p style="font-size:20px; margin:3%;">Inflation is defined as the total increase in product prices over time. If prices rise over time, your money will purchase less today than it did yesterday. If there is inflation over a 30- or 40-year period, your money will be worth much less while the cost of living has risen. Investing your money is one method to combat inflation. If your money earns more than the rate of inflation, it will be worth more tomorrow than it is today.
